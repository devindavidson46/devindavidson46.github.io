title: "About Me"

I am currently in my third year at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC. My major is environmental science with a concentration in life sciences. I am from Raleigh, NC but moved to Boone to find new adventure in a new landscape. I swim, play soccer, DJ, and love getting outside!
