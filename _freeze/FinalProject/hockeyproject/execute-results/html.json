First, we will look at how the points (`Pts`) each team earned can indicate playoff success (`playoff`).\n\nThe data points in a lot of these graphs will be jittered using `position = position_jitter()` allowing us to see overlapping data points. This means that the left-right shift of data within each year column does not mean anything.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = year, y = Pts, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.15)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Points\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the amount of points that teams earned by year and colored by their playoff success](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-rsPts-1.png){#fig-rsPts fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt's interesting that in only 1 these years the top team in points won the Stanley Cup. Additionally it was the fourth worst team to make the playoffs in 2011 to win the Stanley Cup. Next, we will look at goals for (`rsGF`) and goals against (`rsGA`).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = year, y = rsGA, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.15)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Regular Season Goals Against\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the amount of goals against each team had by year and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-rsGA-1.png){#fig-rsGA fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = year, y = rsGF, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.25)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Regular Season Goals For\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the amount of goals for each team had by year and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-rsGF-1.png){#fig-rsGF fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = rsGF, y = rsGA, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Regular Season Goals For\",\n       y = \"Regular Season Goals Against\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the amount of goals for and goals against teams had and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-rsGFGA-1.png){#fig-rsGFGA fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like regular season goals for and goals against are not perfect indicators of playoff success individually. When both goals for and goals against are plotted together, it can be seen that being a team can be successful if they are either good at both goals for and goals against or elite at one and poor at the other. Next we will look at penalty minutes (`rsPIMpG`) to see if being more disciplined in the regular season can indicate a successful playoff team.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = year, y = rsPIMpG, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.25)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Regular Season Penalty Minuter per Game\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the amount of penalty minutes per game teams had by year and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-rsPIM-1.png){#fig-rsPIM fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like regular season penalty minutes is not a good indicator either of playoff success. In fact, in 2006 the Stanley Cup winner had the most regular season penalty minutes in the entire NHL. Next, let's look at special teams: the penalty kill (`rsPKpercent`) and power play (`rsPPpercent`).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = year, y = rsPPpercent, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.25)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Regular Season Power Play Percentage\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the power play success percentage of teams by year and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-rsPP-1.png){#fig-rsPP fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = year, y = rsPKpercent, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.25)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Regular Season Penalty Kill Percentage\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the penalty kill success percentage of teams by year and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-rsPK-1.png){#fig-rsPK fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = rsPKpercent, y = rsPPpercent, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.25)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Regular Season Penalty Kill Percentage\",\n       y = \"Regular Season Power Play Percentage\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the penalty kill and power play success percentages of teams and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-rsPKPP-1.png){#fig-rsPKPP fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt seems that having a balanced special teams is important to having playoff success. Most teams to be only good at one aspect tend to struggle in the playoffs. It looks like having a great penalty kill is slightly more important than having a good power play.\n\nLet's add another variable to the data frame called `WPts` which will indicate the amount of points that come from wins, as opposed to the one point a team gets for an overtime loss.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNHL <- NHL |>\n  mutate(WPts = Pts - rsW)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = Pts, y = WPts, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.25)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Points\",\n       y = \"Points from Wins\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot comparing the points earned to the points earned only from wins of teams and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-rsWPts-1.png){#fig-rsWPts fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSince in the playoffs the only thing that matters in winning, I expected to see a trend that successful teams in the playoffs would be on the top of this line however only 2 of the Stanley Cup winners are. \n\nIt appears that there are not any good indicators of playoff success that come from the regular season. Instead, let's look at playoff stats and see what areas the Stanley Cup winners excel at.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = psGF, y = psGA, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Playoff Goals For\",\n       y = \"Playoff Goals Against\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the goals for and goals against of each team in the playoffs and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-psGFGA-1.png){#fig-psGFGA fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFrom this plot it appears that successful playoff teams need to be good at both scoring and defending however, it looks like limiting goals against is more important than scoring goals. It looks like the teams that give up a lot of goals tend to get eliminated in the conference finals. Let's look at discipline in the playoffs next.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = year, y = psPIMpG, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.25)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Playoff Penalty Minutes per Game\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the amount of penalty minutes per game of teams in the playoffs by year and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-psPIM-1.png){#fig-psPIM fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMore often than not, playoff discipline is important however in none of the studied years was did the Stanley Cup winner have the fewest PIM per game. This could indicate that being disciplined is good however some edge, grit, and hard work that can lead to some penalty minutes is also important. Finally we will look at playoff special teams.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = year, y = psPPpercent, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.25)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Playoff Power Play Percentage\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the power play success percentage of teams by year in the playoffs and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-psPP-1.png){#fig-psPP fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = year, y = psPKpercent, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.25)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Playoff Penalty Kill Percentage\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the penalty kill success percentage of teams by year in the playoffs and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-psPK-1.png){#fig-psPK fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = NHL, aes(x = psPPpercent, y = psPKpercent, color = playoff)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h=0, w=0.25)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Playoff Power Play Percentage\",\n       y = \"Playoff Penalty Kill Percentage\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing the penalty kill and power play success percentage of teams in the playoffs and colored by their playoff success.](hockeyproject_files/figure-html/fig-psPKPP-1.png){#fig-psPKPP fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like having a good penalty kill is more important than having a good powerplay although neither are great indicators of playoff success.\n\nIt looks like there aren't any specific stats that indicate playoff success. I suppose all the matters is winning 16 games and that can be done in a variety of ways. This isn't the most exciting result to find but it is good to know.",
